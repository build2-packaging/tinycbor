1. Build issues

1.1. Warnings

The `%l` format specifier (for one) is not supported by the MS Visual C/C++
runtime (MSVCRT) used by MinGW-W64 (on Windows 10 in our case). A number of
solutions are provided at
https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/wiki2/gnu%20printf/ but they require the
modification of upstream or library user source code.

1.2. Errors

With the MSVC distribution of clang, cbor.h defines the macro
`cbor_static_assert` in terms of `static_assert` which is apparently not
available on that platform. (The LLVM distribution of Clang works fine on
Windows.)

2. Tests

Upstream tests are still a TODO. Note that they use <QtTest> and will
therefore have to be placed into a separate *-tests package.
